# SeeFood_Bachmanity

#At your home sometimes you get frustated when your favourite fruit is not at home or when your mom asks you again and again what to make in lunch/dinner. A solution to this is SEEFOOD which is made by the team Bachmanity. With this app it helps you keep the count of fruits, vegetables and other eatable items stored in refrigerator. If these items finish it will let you know so that you can buy new one before getting frustated and what you can make of the available food at your home by providing different recipies.
